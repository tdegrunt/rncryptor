# Go RNCryptor

Incomplete, only implements the Encrypt method at the moment.

This is a Go port of Rob Napier's Cocoa [RNCryptor](https://github.com/rnapier/RNCryptor/) library. 

This port is based on his [Data Format](https://github.com/rnapier/RNCryptor/wiki/Data-Format) wiki page. It currently only implements version 3.
